# From Data Science to AI Engineering: A Learning Journey

Welcome to the central repository documenting my Data Science life-long learning journey currently with an interest in AI Engineering, specifically focusing on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced search architectures.

## Why?
I am not only learning new tools but investing in building **resilient AI products** tailored to specific organizational needs. By moving beyond generic AI applications, I am developing the capability to create tailored solutions that put organizations ahead of competitors in a **cost-effective and sustainable way**.

This work represents the **foundation of AI Agents**—systems that don't just answer questions, but autonomously interact with data and tools to solve complex business problems.

## Overview and Goal
This repository serves as a portfolio of my technical growth. As a Data Scientist, I am already comfortable with data manipulation and analysis. The goal of this journey is to master the **AI Engineering** stack: building robust, scalable, and secure production systems that leverage LLMs and intelligent data retrieval.

As I learn in public, I will share the final results, but the hurdles, debugging processes, and architectural decisions made along the way.



## The Holistic Vision
This will be grouped into distinct milestones or different projects and practice steps. Each step builds toward a final, comprehensive project: **a production-ready, intelligent search and retrieval system**.

This project will combine:
1.  **Semantic Search:** Utilizing vector embeddings to understand the context of queries.
2.  **Generative AI:** Using LLMs to synthesize results from retrieved data.
3.  **Robust Engineering:** Managing security, data pipelines, and infrastructure.

## Core Technical Foundation (Current Setup)
To ensure high-quality retrieval, I have implemented a robust foundation for storing and searching data:

* **Database:** Elasticsearch (v8.11), configured for secure local development.
* **Authentication:** Basic Auth (`elastic` user) to simulate production security.
* **Python Integration:** Developed a secure connection client tailored for Python 3.13, handling SSL verification for local development environments.
